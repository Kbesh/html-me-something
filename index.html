            <p>There are many different types of chickpeas, but one that is perhaps the least known of the strains are chickpeas with faces. These rarely-found chickpeas are very slow-growing, so much so that less than 10 beans reach maturity per year.</p>

           <p>The faces found on these chickpeas continue to perplex scientists, as they tend to look like the latest dank memes. As the chickpeas have not achieved sentience, the faces on them do not change even after they are picked. Their faces are stuck like that forever, just like your mother warned you about.</p>
